# Event Sequences
Sometimes we want to specify functional conditions that depend on the sequential execution of some program fragments. Since CbC programs are specified using the typed first order logic on which JavaDL is based upon, specification of such conditions is rather involved. This branch provides a solution to this problem, which allows users to specify such conditions using the concept of an *event sequence*.
